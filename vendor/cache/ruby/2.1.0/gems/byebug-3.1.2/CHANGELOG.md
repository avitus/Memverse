# 3.1.2

* Really fix starting `post_mortem` mode in bin/byebug
* Fix starting line tracing in bin/byebug


# 3.1.1

* Fix starting `post_mortem` mode in bin/byebug


# 3.1.0

* `show commands` moved to a separate `history` command.
* Byebug.start can't recieve options any more. Any program settings you
want applied from the start should be set in .byebugrc.
* `trace` command has been removed. Line tracing functionality should be
enabled through the `linetrace` setting whereas the global variable
tracing functionality is now provided through the `tracevar` command.
* `version` setting has been removed. It was not really a setting because it
couldn't be set. Use `byebug --version` to check byebug's version.
* `arg` setting removed. Program restart arguments should be set through
`restart` command from now on.
* `linetrace_plus` setting has been renamed to `tracing_plus`.


# 3.0.0

- Bugfixes
 * Fix post_mortem mode
 * Command history is also saved after regular program termination, not only
after quitting with the `q` command.
 * Fix failure when calling Byebug.start with Timeout::timeout (see #54), thanks
@zmoazeni!

- Changes
 * `show commands` command for listing history of previous byebug commands now
behaves like shell's `history` command.
 * Changes in `history` commands: see
[50e6ad8](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/commit/50e6ad8)
 * Changes in `finish` semantics and in the C extension API: see
[61f9b4d](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/commit/61f9b4d)
 * The `init` option for Byebug.start has been removed. Information to make the
`restart` command work is always saved now.

- Features
 * Allow disabling post_mortem mode
