Sanitize History
================================================================================

Version 2.0.6 (2013-07-10)
--------------------------

* Fixed: Version 2.0.5 inadvertently included some work-in-progress changes that
  shouldn't have made their way into the master branch. This is what happens
  when I release before coffee instead of after.


Version 2.0.5 (2013-07-10)
--------------------------

* Loosened the Nokogiri dependency back to >= 1.4.4 to allow Sanitize to coexist
  in newer Rubies with other libraries that restrict Nokogiri to 1.5.x for 1.8.7
  compatibility. Sanitize still no longer supports 1.8.7, but this should make
  life easier for people who need those other libs.


Version 2.0.4 (2013-06-12)
--------------------------

* Added `Sanitize.clean_document`, which sanitizes a full HTML document rather
  than just a fragment. [Ben Anderson]

* Nokogiri dependency bumped to 1.6.x.

* Dropped support for Ruby versions older than 1.9.2.


Version 2.0.3 (2011-07-01)
--------------------------

* Loosened the Nokogiri dependency to allow Nokogiri 1.5.x.


Version 2.0.2 (2011-05-21)
--------------------------

* Fixed a bug in which a protocol like "java\script:" would be translated to
  "java%5Cscript:" and allowed through the filter when relative URLs were
  enabled. This didn't actually allow malicious code to run, but it is
  undesired behavior.


Version 2.0.1 (2011-03-16)
--------------------------

* Updated the protocol regex to anchor at the beginning of the string rather
  than the beginning of a line. [Eaden McKee]


Version 2.0.0 (2011-01-15)
--------------------------

* The environment data passed into transformers and the return values expected
  from transformers have changed. Old transformers will need to be updated.
  See the README for details.
* Transformers now receive nodes of all types, not just element nodes.
* Sanitize's own core filtering logic is now implemented as a set of always-on
  transformers.
* The default value for the `:output` config is now `:html`. Previously it was
  `:xhtml`.
* Added a `:whitespace_elements` config, which specifies elements (such as
  `<br>` and `<p>`) that should be replaced with whitespace when removed in
  order to preserve readability. See the README for the default list of
  elements that will be replaced with whitespace when removed.
* Added a `:transformers_breadth` config, which may be used to specify
  transformers that should traverse nodes in a breadth-first mode rather than
  the default depth-first mode.
* Added the `abbr`, `dfn`, `kbd`, `mark`, `s`, `samp`, `time`, and `var`
  elements to the whitelists for the basic and relaxed configs.
* Added the `bdo`, `del`, `figcaption`, `figure`, `hgroup`, `ins`, `rp`, `rt`,
  `ruby`, and `wbr` elements to the whitelist for the relaxed config.
* The `dir`, `lang`, and `title` attributes are now whitelisted for all
  elements in the relaxed config.
* Bumped minimum Nokogiri version to 1.4.4 to avoid a bug in 1.4.2+
  (issue #315) that caused `</body></html>` to be appended to the CDATA inside
  unterminated script and style elements.


Version 1.2.1 (2010-04-20)
--------------------------

* Added a `:remove_contents` config setting. If set to `true`, Sanitize will
  remove the contents of all non-whitelisted elements in addition to the
  elements themselves. If set to an array of element names, Sanitize will
  remove the contents of only those elements (when filtered), and leave the
  contents of other filtered elements. [Thanks to Rafael Souza for the array
  option]
* Added an `:output_encoding` config setting to allow the character encoding
  for HTML output to be specified. The default is utf-8.
* The environment hash passed into transformers now includes a `:node_name`
  item containing the lowercase name of the current HTML node (e.g. "div").
* Returning anything other than a Hash or nil from a transformer will now
  raise a meaningful `Sanitize::Error` exception rather than an unintended
  `NameError`.


Version 1.2.0 (2010-01-17)
--------------------------

* Requires Nokogiri ~> 1.4.1.
* Added support for transformers, which allow you to filter and alter nodes
  using your own custom logic, on top of (or instead of) Sanitize's core
  filter. See the README for details and examples.
* Added `Sanitize.clean_node!`, which sanitizes a `Nokogiri::XML::Node` and
  all its children.
* Added elements `<h1>` through `<h6>` to the Relaxed whitelist. [Suggested by
  David Reese]


Version 1.1.0 (2009-10-11)
--------------------------

* Migrated from Hpricot to Nokogiri. Requires libxml2 >= 2.7.2 [Adam Hooper]
* Added an `:output` config setting to allow the output format to be
  specified. Supported formats are `:xhtml` (the default) and `:html` (which
  outputs HTML4).
* Changed protocol regex to ensure Sanitize doesn't kill URLs with colons in
  path segments. [Peter Cooper]


Version 1.0.8 (2009-04-23)
--------------------------

* Added a workaround for an Hpricot bug that prevents attribute names from
  being downcased in recent versions of Hpricot. This was exploitable to
  prevent non-whitelisted protocols from being cleaned. [Reported by Ben
  Wanicur]


Version 1.0.7 (2009-04-11)
--------------------------

* Requires Hpricot 0.8.1+, which is finally compatible with Ruby 1.9.1.
* Fixed a bug that caused named character entities containing digits (like
  `&sup2;`) to be escaped when they shouldn't have been. [Reported by
  Sebastian Steinmetz]


Version 1.0.6 (2009-02-23)
--------------------------

* Removed htmlentities gem dependency.
* Existing well-formed character entity references in the input string are now
  preserved rather than being decoded and re-encoded.
* The `'` character is now encoded as `&#39;` instead of `&apos;` to prevent
  problems in IE6.
* You can now specify the symbol `:all` in place of an element name in the
  attributes config hash to allow certain attributes on all elements. [Thanks
  to Mutwin Kraus]


Version 1.0.5 (2009-02-05)
--------------------------

* Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.0.3 that prevented non-whitelisted
  protocols from being cleaned when relative URLs were allowed. [Reported by
  Dev Purkayastha]
* Fixed "undefined method `parent='" exceptions caused by parser changes in
  edge Hpricot.


Version 1.0.4 (2009-01-16)
--------------------------

* Fixed a bug that made it possible to sneak a non-whitelisted element through
  by repeating it several times in a row. All versions of Sanitize prior to
  1.0.4 are vulnerable. [Reported by Cristobal]


Version 1.0.3 (2009-01-15)
--------------------------

* Fixed a bug whereby incomplete Unicode or hex entities could be used to
  prevent non-whitelisted protocols from being cleaned. Since IE6 and Opera
  still decode the incomplete entities, users of those browsers may be
  vulnerable to malicious script injection on websites using versions of
  Sanitize prior to 1.0.3.


Version 1.0.2 (2009-01-04)
--------------------------

* Fixed a bug that caused an exception to be thrown when parsing a valueless
  attribute that's expected to contain a URL.


Version 1.0.1 (2009-01-01)
--------------------------

* You can now specify `:relative` in a protocol config array to allow
  attributes containing relative URLs with no protocol. The Basic and Relaxed
  configs have been updated to allow relative URLs.
* Added a workaround for an Hpricot bug that causes HTML entities for
  non-ASCII characters to be replaced by question marks, and all other
  entities to be destructively decoded.


Version 1.0.0 (2008-12-25)
--------------------------

* First release.
