[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/doorkeeper.png)](https://rubygems.org/gems/doorkeeper)

Doorkeeper is a gem that makes it easy to introduce OAuth 2 provider functionality to your application.

The gem is under constant development. It is based in the [version 22 of the OAuth specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22) and it still does not support all OAuth features.

## Requirements

- Ruby 1.9.3 or 2.0.0
- Rails 3.1, 3.2, 4.0
- ORM ActiveRecord, Mongoid 2, Mongoid 3, MongoMapper

## Installation

Put this in your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'doorkeeper', '~> 0.7.0'
```

Run the installation generator with:

    rails generate doorkeeper:install

This will install the doorkeeper initializer into `config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb`.

## Configuration

### Active Record

By default doorkeeper is configured to use active record, so to start you have to generate the migration tables:

    rails generate doorkeeper:migration

Don't forget to run the migration with:

    rake db:migrate

### Mongoid / MongoMapper

Doorkeeper currently supports MongoMapper, Mongoid 2 and 3. To start using it, you have to set the `orm` configuration:

``` ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  orm :mongoid2 # or :mongoid3, :mongo_mapper
end
```

#### Mongoid indexes

Make sure you create indexes for doorkeeper models. You can do this either by running `rake db:mongoid:create_indexes` or (if you're using Mongoid 2) by adding `autocreate_indexes: true` to your `config/mongoid.yml`

#### MongoMapper indexes

Generate the `db/indexes.rb` file and create indexes for the doorkeeper models:

    rails generate doorkeeper:mongo_mapper:indexes
    rake db:index

### Routes

The installation script will also automatically add the Doorkeeper routes into your app, like this:

``` ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  use_doorkeeper
  # your routes
end
```

This will mount following routes:

    GET       /oauth/authorize
    POST      /oauth/authorize
    DELETE    /oauth/authorize
    POST      /oauth/token
    resources /oauth/applications
    GET       /oauth/authorized_applications
    DELETE    /oauth/authorized_applications/:id
    GET       /oauth/token/info

For more information on how to customize routes, check out [this page on the wiki](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Customizing-routes).

### Authenticating

You need to configure Doorkeeper in order to provide resource_owner model and authentication block `initializers/doorkeeper.rb`

``` ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  resource_owner_authenticator do
    User.find(session[:current_user_id]) || redirect_to(login_url)
  end
end
```

This code is run in the context of your application so you have access to your models, session or routes helpers. However,
since this code is not run in the context of your application's ApplicationController it doesn't have access
to the methods defined over there.

If you use [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), you may want to use warden to authenticate the block:

``` ruby
resource_owner_authenticator do
  current_user || warden.authenticate!(:scope => :user)
end
```

Side note: when using devise you have access to current_user as devise extends entire ActionController::Base with the current_#{mapping}.

If you are not using devise, you may want to check other ways of authentication [here](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Authenticating-using-Clearance-or-DIY).

## Protecting resources with OAuth (a.k.a your API endpoint)

To protect your API with OAuth, doorkeeper only requires you to call `doorkeeper_for` helper, specifying the actions you want to protect.

For example, if you have a products controller under api/v1, you can require the OAuth authentication with:

``` ruby
class Api::V1::ProductsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :all                     # Require access token for all actions
  doorkeeper_for :all, :except => :index  # All actions except index
  doorkeeper_for :index, :show            # Only for index and show action

  # your actions
end
```

You don't need to setup any before filter, `doorkeeper_for` will handle that for you.

You can pass `if` or `unless` blocks that would specify when doorkeeper has to guard the access.

``` ruby
class Api::V1::ProductsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :all, :if => lambda { request.xhr? }
end
```

### ActionController::Metal integration and other integrations

The `doorkeeper_for` filter is intended to work with ActionController::Metal too. You only need to include the required `ActionController` modules:

```ruby
class MetalController < ActionController::Metal
  include AbstractController::Callbacks
  include ActionController::Head
  include Doorkeeper::Helpers::Filter

  doorkeeper_for :all
end
```

For more information about integration and other integrations, check out [the related wiki page](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/ActionController::Metal-with-doorkeeper).

### Access Token Scopes

You can also require the access token to have specific scopes in certain actions:

First configure the scopes in `initializers/doorkeeper.rb`

```ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  default_scopes :public # if no scope was requested, this will be the default
  optional_scopes :admin, :write
end
```

The in your controllers:

```ruby
class Api::V1::ProductsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :index, :show,    :scopes => [:public]
  doorkeeper_for :update, :create, :scopes => [:admin, :write]
end
```

For a more detailed explanation about scopes usage, check out the related [page in the wiki](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Using-Scopes).

### Authenticated resource owner

If you want to return data based on the current resource owner, in other words, the access token owner, you may want to define a method in your controller that returns the resource owner instance:

``` ruby
class Api::V1::CredentialsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :all
  respond_to     :json

  # GET /me.json
  def me
    respond_with current_resource_owner
  end

  private

  # Find the user that owns the access token
  def current_resource_owner
    User.find(doorkeeper_token.resource_owner_id) if doorkeeper_token
  end
end
```

In this example, we're returning the credentials (`me.json`) of the access token owner.

### Applications list

By default, the applications list (`/oauth/applications`) is public available. To protect the endpoint you should uncomment these lines:

```ruby
# config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb
Doorkeeper.configure do
  admin_authenticator do |routes|
    Admin.find_by_id(session[:admin_id]) || redirect_to(routes.new_admin_session_url)
  end
end
```

The logic is the same as the `resource_owner_authenticator` block. **Note:** since the application list is just a scaffold, it's recommended to either customize the controller used by the list or skip the controller at all. For more information see the page [in the wiki](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Customizing-routes).

- [CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/%5BCORS%5D-Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing)

## Upgrading

If you want to upgrade doorkeeper to a new version, check out the [upgrading notes](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Migration-from-old-versions) and take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Development

To run the local engine server:

```
rails=3.2.8 orm=active_record bundle install
rails=3.2.8 orm=active_record bundle exec rails server
````

By default, it uses the latest Rails version with ActiveRecord. To run the tests:

```
rails=3.2.8 orm=active_record bundle exec rake
```

Or you might prefer to run `script/run_all` to integrate against all ORMs.
