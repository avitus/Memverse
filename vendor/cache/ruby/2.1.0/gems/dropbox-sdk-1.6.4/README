Getting a Dropbox API key

You need a Dropbox API key to make API requests.
- Go to: https://dropbox.com/developers/apps
- If you've already registered an app, click on the "Options" link to see the
  app's API key and secret.
- Otherwise, click "Create an app" to register an app.  Choose "Full Dropbox" or
  "App Folder" depending on your needs.
  See: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference#permissions

Using the Dropbox API

Full documentation: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/

Before your app can access a Dropbox user's files, the user must authorize your
application using OAuth 2.  Successfully completing this authorization flow
gives you an "access token" for the user's Dropbox account, which grants you the
ability to make Dropbox API calls to access their files.

- Authorization example for a web app: web_file_browser.rb
- Authorization example for a command-line tool:
  https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/start/ruby

Once you have an access token, create a DropboxClient instance and start making
API calls.

You only need to perform the authorization process once per user.  Once you have
an access token for a user, save it somewhere persistent, like in a database.
The next time that user visits your app, you can skip the authorization process
and go straight to making API calls.

----------------------------------
Running the Examples

There are example programs included in the tarball.  Before you can run an
example, you need to edit the ".rb" file and put your Dropbox API app key and
secret in the "APP_KEY" and "APP_SECRET" constants.
