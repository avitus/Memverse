    # Each command is added as part of the pipeline, grouped with an `echo`
    # command to pass along the command's index in @commands and it's exit status.
    # The command's STDERR is redirected to FD#4, and the `echo` command to
    # report the "index|exit status" is redirected to FD#3.
    # Each command's STDOUT will be connected to the STDIN of the next subshell.
    # The entire pipeline is run within a container group, which redirects
    # FD#3 to STDOUT and FD#4 to STDERR so these can be collected.
    # FD#1 is redirected to STDERR so that any output from the final command
    # on STDOUT will generate warnings, since the final command should not
    # attempt to write to STDOUT, as this would interfere with collecting
    # the exit statuses.
    #
    # There is no guarantee as to the order of this output, which is why the
    # command's index in @commands is passed along with it's exit status.
    # And, if multiple commands output messages on STDERR, those messages
    # may be interleaved. Interleaving of the "index|exit status" outputs
    # should not be an issue, given the small byte size of the data being written.
