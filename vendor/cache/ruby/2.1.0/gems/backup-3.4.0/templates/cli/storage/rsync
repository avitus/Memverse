  # RSync [Storage]
  #
  # The default `mode` is :ssh, which does not require the use
  # of an rsync daemon on the remote. If you wish to connect
  # directly to an rsync daemon, or via SSH using daemon features,
  # :rsync_daemon and :ssh_daemon modes are also available.
  #
  # If no `host` is specified, the transfer will be a local
  # operation. `mode` and `compress` will have no meaning.
  #
  # See the documentation on the Wiki for details.
