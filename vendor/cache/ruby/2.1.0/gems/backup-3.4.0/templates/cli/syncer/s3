  # Amazon S3 [Syncer]
  #
  # Available Regions:
  #
  #   - ap-northeast-1
  #   - ap-southeast-1
  #   - eu-west-1
  #   - us-east-1
  #   - us-west-1
  #
  # Mirroring:
  #
  #   When enabled it will keep an exact mirror of your filesystem on S3.
  #   This means that when you remove a file from the filesystem,
  #   it will also remote it from S3.
  #
  # Concurrency:
  #
  #   `concurrency_type` may be set to:
  #
  #     - false (default)
  #     - :threads
  #     - :processes
  #
  #   Set `concurrency_level` to the number of threads/processes to use.
  #   Defaults to 2.
