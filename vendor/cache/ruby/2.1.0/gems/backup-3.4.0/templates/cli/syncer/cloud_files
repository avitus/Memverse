  # Rackspace Cloud Files [Syncer]
  #
  # Available Auth URLs:
  #
  #   - https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com     (US - Default)
  #   - https://lon.auth.api.rackspacecloud.com (UK)
  #
  # Servicenet:
  #
  #   Set this to 'true' if Backup runs on a Rackspace server.
  #   It will avoid transfer charges and it's more performant.
  #
  # Mirroring:
  #
  #   When enabled it will keep an exact mirror of your filesystem on Cloud Files.
  #   This means that when you remove a file from the filesystem,
  #   it will also remote it from Cloud Files.
  #
  # Concurrency:
  #
  #   `concurrency_type` may be set to:
  #
  #     - false (default)
  #     - :threads
  #     - :processes
  #
  #   Set `concurrency_level` to the number of threads/processes to use.
  #   Defaults to 2.
