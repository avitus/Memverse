  # Archive [Archive]
  #
  # Adding a file or directory (including sub-directories):
  #   archive.add "/path/to/a/file.rb"
  #   archive.add "/path/to/a/directory/"
  #
  # Excluding a file or directory (including sub-directories):
  #   archive.exclude "/path/to/an/excluded_file.rb"
  #   archive.exclude "/path/to/an/excluded_directory
  #
  # By default, relative paths will be relative to the directory
  # where `backup perform` is executed, and they will be expanded
  # to the root of the filesystem when added to the archive.
  #
  # If a `root` path is set, relative paths will be relative to the
  # given `root` path and will not be expanded when added to the archive.
  #
  #   archive.root '/path/to/archive/root'
