# Contributing

First of all, thank you for even opening this file up!  I hope you find
it worthwhile to help out with Sidekiq.

## Issues

When opening an issue, please include a **backtrace** with your error.

## Code

If you're interested in helping or contributing to Sidekiq, here's
some known areas which need improvement:

* The Web UI and sidekiq.org website could always use more polish.  If you have an eye for design and an idea for improvement, please open an issue and let us know.
* The [Sidekiq issue tracker](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues) usually has a few ideas
* Your brilliant idea which I haven't listed!

It's always best to open an issue before investing a lot of time into a
fix or new functionality.  Functionality must meet my design goals and
vision for the project to be accepted; I would be happy to discuss how
your idea can best fit into Sidekiq.


## Sponsorship

If you've got more money than time and want to sponsor Sidekiq's continued support, your company can buy [Sidekiq Pro](http://sidekiq.org/pro).  You get great functionality, I continue to fix bugs and enhance Sidekiq for years to come.
