= simple-random

Generate random numbers sampled from the following distributions:

* Beta
* Cauchy
* Chi square
* Dirichlet
* Exponential
* Gamma
* Inverse gamma
* Laplace (double exponential)
* Normal
* Student t
* Uniform
* Weibull

Based on John D. Cook's SimpleRNG[http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/SimpleRNG.aspx] C# library.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
