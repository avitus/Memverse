# Do not automatically require minitest, since this will break with rbx-2.2.5.
# rbx-2.2.5 helpfully bundles minitest-5.3.0.
# Our tests don't work with minitest-5.3.0.
# minitest-4.7.5 is the version we want to use here, but if you just do
# a require 'minitest' on rbx-2.2.5, you'll get 5.3.0 (since 4.7.5 doesn't
# actually have a minitest.rb file under lib/). The :require => false prevents
# us from inadvertently loading minitest 5.3.0 on rbx (we'll require
# minitest/unit instead via a different path).
