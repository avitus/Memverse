module Localeapp::TranslationHelperMonkeyPatch
  # Delegates to I18n#translate but also performs two additional functions. First, it'll catch MissingTranslationData exceptions
  # and turn them into inline spans that contains the missing key, such that you can see in a view what is missing where.
  #
  # Second, it'll scope the key by the current partial if the key starts with a period. So if you call translate(".foo") from the
  # people/index.html.erb template, you'll actually be calling I18n.translate("people.index.foo"). This makes it less repetitive
  # to translate many keys within the same partials and gives you a simple framework for scoping them consistently. If you don't
  # prepend the key with a period, nothing is converted.
