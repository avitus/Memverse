= Test::Unit (Classic)

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/test-unit/

== DESCRIPTION:

Test::Unit (Classic) - Nathaniel Talbott's originial test-unit,
externalized from the ruby project as a gem (for tool developers).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* This is the original Test::Unit, taken straight from the ruby
  distribution. It is being distributed as a gem to allow tool
  builders to use it as a stand-alone package. (The test framework in
  ruby is going to radically change very soon).
* DO NOT INSTALL THIS GEM unless you're active state or some other
  development tool provider! You don't need it.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install test-unit
