== 0.8.3 2007-11-16

* *args and &block are passed at #send time [thx Lawrence Pit]

== 0.8.2 2007-09-07

* Updated gem structure to use newgem's latest concepts - rubigen integration, and config folder instead of
large Rakefile
* respond_to? also tests respond_to?(callmethod) against the first element of the array, to protect against matching :each_pair etc

== 0.8.1 2007-09-06

* Ok ok ok, now it works in all places I've had it fail before
* respond_to? now has an optional 2nd parameter as required by ActiveRecord's AssociationProxy
* MAP_BY_METHOD_FORMAT only created if doesn't exist

== 0.8.0 2007-09-05

* Works in Rails - respond_to? must return true or false, or rather, cannot return MatchData [thx Mislav MarohniÄ‡]
* Additional mapper methods: sort_by, and group_by, index_by (in activesupport gem)

== 0.7.0 2007-08-11

* ActiveRecord AssociationProxy support (company.users.map_by_name now works)
* Refactored svn into trunk/tags/branches
* Added hoe
* Added website

== 0.6

* Removed explicit singularize method.
* Instead, singularize option only supported if another gem (e.g. activesupport)
  provides a singularize method for strings.
