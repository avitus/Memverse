h1. Map By Method

h1. <code>["1","2","3"]. map_by_to_i => [1,2,3]</code>

h2. Installation

<pre>gem install map_by_method</pre>
    
h2. Usage

<pre>
> a = ["1", "2", "3"]
> a.map_by_to_i
=> [1, 2, 3]
</pre>
Can be used with ActiveRecord associations (since 0.7.0)
 
<pre>> company = Company.find_by_name "Dr Nic Academy"
> company.employees.count
=> 1
> company.employees.map_by_name
=> ["Dr Nic"]
</pre>    

Why use this?
 
I think its much easier to type and read than its two equivalents:
   
<pre>> company.employees.map { |employee| employee.name }
or
> company.employees.map &:name
</pre>
