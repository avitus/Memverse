	<h3>What is Supermemo</h3>
	
	<p>SuperMemo is based on the insight that there is an ideal moment to practice what you've learned. 
	Practice too soon and you waste your time. Practice too late and you've forgotten the material and have to relearn it. 
	The right time to practice is just at the moment you're about to forget. Unfortunately, this moment is different for 
	every person and each bit of information. Imagine a pile of thousands of flash cards. Somewhere in this pile are the 
	ones you should be practicing right now. Which are they? </p>

	<p>Fortunately, human forgetting follows a pattern. We forget exponentially. A graph of our likelihood of 
	getting the correct answer on a quiz sweeps quickly downward over time and then levels off. 
	This pattern has long been known to cognitive psychology, but it has been difficult to put to practical use. 
	It's too complex for us to employ with our naked brains. </p>
	
	<h3>How the SuperMemo Algorithm Works</h3>
	
	<p>SuperMemo is a program that keeps track of discrete bits of information you've learned and want to retain. 
	For example, say you're memorizing bible verses. Your chance of recalling a given verse declines over 
	time according to a predictable pattern. The SuperMemo algorithm tracks this forgetting curve and reminds you to 
	rehearse your knowledge when your chance of recalling it has dropped to, say, 90 percent. When you first learn 
	a new bible verse, your chance of recalling it will drop quickly. But after SuperMemo reminds you of the verse, 
	the rate of forgetting levels out. The algorithm tracks this new decline and waits longer to quiz you the next time.</p>
