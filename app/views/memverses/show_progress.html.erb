			<p>You currently need about <span class=text-highlight><%=current_user.work_load%> minutes per day</span> on average to review your memory verses. If this 
			is less time than you would like to spend, we recommend 
			<span class=text-highlight><%= link_to 'adding one or two more verses', add_verse_path %></span>. Remember that 
			as you memorize your verses, the required time will go down.</p>
			
			<p>Verses are classified as "Memorized" once the interval between review has grown to more than 30 days. The interval starts at 1 day 
			and increases as you correctly recall the verse.</p>
			
			<p>If you have extra time, it's a good idea to occasionally 
			<span class=text-highlight><%= link_to 'review the references for your memory verses', start_ref_test_path %></span>, 
			particularly if you know the text of the verse but have difficulty matching verses with the correct reference.</p>
