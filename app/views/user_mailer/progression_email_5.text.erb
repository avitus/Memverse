<!--[Encouragement / Guidance]-->
Every journey begins with the first step. It looks as though you began a memorization session but didn't get all the way through your verses. It's a good idea to review all the verses that are due on any given day as that will keep the memory of the verse fresh.
	
If you found that you had too many verses to review in one session, we highly recommend deleting some of your memory verses. Five to ten verses is a good number to start with. More than that can rapidly become discouraging.

<!--[Reminder]-->
<% if @user.overdue_verses == 1 %>
	Today you have only have one memory verse that is overdue for memorization.
<% else %>
	Today you have <%= @user.overdue_verses %> memory verses that are overdue for memorization.
