	<ol>
		<li><h3>Web Design</h3> 
			If you know Ruby and Rails and would like to add features to Memverse we would definitely
			welcome the help. Two areas that we are considering are iPhone/Android support and a Facebook application.
		</li>
		
		<li><h3>Help localize Memverse</h3> 

			If you speak another language and would like to help localize Memverse.com or manage
			another foreign language translation, it would greatly expand the reach of the website</li>
		
		<li><h3>Tell others about Memverse</h3> 
			Word of mouth is still the best way to spread the word. But email
			works pretty well too. You can download a flyer about MemVerse created by Dakota Lynch, one of our users, by <a href="/docs/MemVerse.pdf">clicking here</a>.</li>

		<li><h3>Create an App</h3> 
			Explore our <a href="/api/index.html">API</a> and let us know if you'd like to build on the Memverse platform.
		</li>
